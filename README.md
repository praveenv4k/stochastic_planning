Stochastic Planner evaluation project

About:
* The aim of the project is to study the Stochastic planning for the specific iCub grasping
of a moving object. Markov decision process and Partially Observable MDP planning methods are 
focused.

Requirements : 

* CMake is required. 
* YARP (www.yarp.it) and iCub (http://www.icub.org/) modules are necessary to be installed
* jsoncpp library amalgamation source is included in the project

Build steps:

* Open Terminal and change directory to the stochastic_planner directory
* mkdir build
* cd build
* cmake ..
* make
